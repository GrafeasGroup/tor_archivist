# Changelog

We follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) as a way of measuring stability of an update. This
means we will never make a backwards-incompatible change within a major version of the project.

## [UNRELEASED]

- Link to the transcription comment directly in archive posts, rather than to the original post itself.

## v0.2.0 (2017-09-06)

- Only archive once every 30 minutes
- No longer remove posts immediately after completion, but instead remove all completed ones every round
- Fix the removal of "Disregard" posts

## v0.1.0 (2017-08-21)

- Initial split from `tor` into one package per bot
